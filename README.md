Fully Dynamic Distance Query
==============================
This is an implementation of a distance query algorithm on massive dynamic networks (CIKM '16). This implementation enables you to efficiently compute exact point-to-point distance on dynamic large complex networks (social networks, web graphs, co-author networks). If you have interest in our method and experimental results, please see [our paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2983323.2983731).

## Usage
I will write it soon.
